# SnakeGame
Created during MCA just for passion and learning purpose

I have used Netbean IDE.

Most important thing is that you have to change below path based on you plateform

I have used mac os so my path is like below
``` Java

b = new ImageIcon("/Users/Amit/Desktop/My Netbean Projects/battlefield/src/battlefield/a.png");

```
